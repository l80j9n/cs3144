**Experiment Summary: Influence of Emotional State on Curiosity-Driven Language Learning**
**Objective:**
To investigate how emotional state affects curiosity-driven learning in the context of acquiring new words.
**Methodology:**
1. **Participants:**
- Complete 70 trials in total.
- In each trial, participants are given two options:
- **Reading Test:** Participants read 3 sentences ending with the same word. This option checks participants' attention (i.e., if they are reading or not), but there is no specific test on comprehension.
- **Discovery Method:** Participants discover the meaning through context or hints. They read 3 sentences ending with a fictional word and then type the meaning of the fictional word.
For example:
- Sentence 1: "Desde que era pequeña me encanta comer ateloso."
- Sentence 2: "Ha subido mucho el precio del ateloso."
- Sentence 3: "El bocadillo estará mucho más bueno con ateloso."
- The expected translation from the participant is: "tomate."
- Each option is associated with a monetary reward ranging from 1 to 10 euros, indicating the potential reward in a final lottery (recompensa_discovery and recompensa_reading). When an option is chosen, there is a 1/35 chance of winning that reward after completion.
2. **Trial Structure:**
- There are 2 blocks, easy and hard.(bloque 2 and bloque 4)
- Each participant completes 35 trials per block.
- In each trial, the two options are presented along with their associated rewards.
- The difference between the rewards for the Reading Test and Discovery Method ranges from -5 to +5 euros.
- The probability of earning a reward is independent of task performance, and participants are aware of this.
3. **Task Performance:**
- **Discovery Method:** After selecting this option and learning the new word, participants write down the meaning of the fictional word.
- Answers are checked for correctness.
4. **Emotional and Confidence Assessment:**
- Emotional valence and confidence (only for the Discovery Method) in their responses are assessed for each trial. Participants are asked to rate them from 1 to 9.
5. **Recognition Test:**
- After the learning phase (after all trials), a recognition test is conducted (only for the Discovery Method).
- Participants are presented with the words they saw before and must choose the correct translation from two presented options.
6. **Attentional Check:**
- Every 5 trials, participants perform. an attention check task.
- They are shown a sentence and asked if they saw it in the last 5 trials.
The columns in the CSV file are the following.
